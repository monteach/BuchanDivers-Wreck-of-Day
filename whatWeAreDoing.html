One huge boiler seen, but close to the bow and next to a massive boiler cradle, perhaps for another boiler - which would put our original identification into question.

Lovely wrecks, we are in the process of assessing all the information we collected on the dive in an attempt to name them.  More soon.</td></tr>

After weeks lost to diving through poor weather and now boat problems, we managed to get out on a mark and took video footage from the surface.  This footage confirms the wreck of a submarine lying 100m below us.  From research conducted by Kevin Heath and Michael Lowrey, this can only be the U 77 lost in 1916.
